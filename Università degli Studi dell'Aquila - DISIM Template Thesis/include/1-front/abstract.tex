\section*{Abstract}
This thesis explores the automatic generation of pull request messages in distributed version control systems using a large linguistic model (LLM). The goal is to develop a dataset and a modeling approach capable of predicting and generating effective messages to describe code changes, based on metadata and details of the changes made. The methodology involves extracting pull requests from open-source projects written in Java on GitHub, storing them in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). Subsequently, Ollama was chosen as the LLM, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to structure a scalable and robust prompt that combines the information collected from the dataset in order to generate accurate descriptions of pull requests.
